      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am an aspiring Web Developer, ready to dive head first into whatever lies ahead of me!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Santa Rosa, California</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy reading, writing and graphic design. More specifically I enjoy Dungeons & Dragons and designing exciting adventures!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would love to work for Wizards of the Coast or Paizo, working on their web team and working with the creative staff to bring their works to life</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Napa, California</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Ostensibly, I wish to leap into a new career path that will afford me the opportunity to tap into a long forgotten passion of mine.  I have always been fascinated with both the design and construction of webpages and used to build them for fun when I was younger and in middle school and high school. Bringing myself back to those roots is both exciting and scary, but ultimately this is something I should started doing years ago.</p>
